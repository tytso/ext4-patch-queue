ext4: fix i_blocks/quota accounting when extent insertion fails

From: Maxim Patlasov <maxim.patlasov@gmail.com>

The current implementation of ext4_free_blocks() always calls
dquot_free_block This looks quite sensible in the most cases: blocks
to be freed are associated with inode and were accounted in quota and
i_blocks some time ago.

However, there is a case when blocks to free were not accounted by the
time calling ext4_free_blocks() yet:

1. delalloc is on, write_begin pre-allocated some space in quota
2. write-back happens, ext4 allocates some blocks in ext4_ext_map_blocks()
3. then ext4_ext_map_blocks() gets an error (e.g.  ENOSPC) from
   ext4_ext_insert_extent() and calls ext4_free_blocks().

In this scenario, ext4_free_blocks() calls dquot_free_block() who, in
turn, decrements i_blocks for blocks which were not accounted yet (due
to delalloc) After clean umount, e2fsck reports something like:

> Inode 21, i_blocks is 5080, should be 5128.  Fix<y>?
because i_blocks was erroneously decremented as explained above.

The patch fixes the problem by passing the new flag
EXT4_FREE_BLOCKS_NO_QUOT_UPDATE to ext4_free_blocks(), to request
that the dquot_free_block() call be skipped.
