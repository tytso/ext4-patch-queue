ext4: fix NULL pointer dereference when journal restart fails

From: Lukas Czerner <lczerner@redhat.com>

Currently when journal restart fails, we'll have the h_transaction of
the handle set to NULL to indicate that the handle has been effectively
aborted. We handle this situation quietly in the jbd2_journal_stop() and just
free the handle and exit because everything else has been done before we
attempted (and failed) to restart the journal.

Unfortunately there are a number of problems with that approach
introduced with commit

41a5b913197c "jbd2: invalidate handle if jbd2_journal_restart()
fails"

First of all in ext4 jbd2_journal_stop() will be called through
__ext4_journal_stop() where we would try to get a hold of the superblock
by dereferencing h_transaction which in this case would lead to NULL
pointer dereference and crash.

In addition we're going to free the handle regardless of the refcount
which is bad as well, because others up the call chain will still
reference the handle so we might potentially reference already freed
memory.

Moreover it's expected that we'll get aborted handle as well as detached
handle in some of the journalling function as the error propagates up
the stack, so it's unnecessary to call WARN_ON every time we get
detached handle.

And finally we might leak some memory by forgetting to free reserved
handle in jbd2_journal_stop() in the case where handle was detached from
the transaction (h_transaction is NULL).

Fix the NULL pointer dereference in __ext4_journal_stop() by just
calling jbd2_journal_stop() quietly as suggested by Jan Kara. Also fix
the potential memory leak in jbd2_journal_stop() and use proper
handle refcounting before we attempt to free it to avoid use-after-free
issues.

And finally remove all WARN_ON(!transaction) from the code so that we do
not get random traces when something goes wrong because when journal
restart fails we will get to some of those functions.

v2: As Jan Kara pointed out setting h_transaction to NULL is actually
desirable because the handle was detached from that transaction.
