ext4: only call ext4_jbd2_file_inode when an inode has been extended

In delayed allocation mode, it's important to only call
ext4_jbd2_file_inode when the file has been extended.  This is
necessary to avoid a race which first got introduced in commit
678aaf481, but which was made much more common with the introduction
of the "punch hole" functionality.  (Especially when dioread_nolock
was enabled; when I could reliably reproduce this problem with
xfstests #74.)

The race is this: If while trying to writeback a delayed allocation
inode, there is a need to map delalloc blocks, and we run out of space
in the journal, *and* at the same time the inode is already on the
committing transaction's t_inode_list (because for example while doing
the punch hole operation, ext4_jbd2_file_inode() is called), then the
commit operation will wait for the inode to finish all of its pending
writebacks by calling filemap_fdatawait(), but since that inode has
one or more pages with the PageWriteback flag set, the commit
operation will wait forever, and the so the writeback of the inode can
never take place, and the kjournald thread and the writeback thread
end up waiting for each other --- forever.

It's important at this point to recall why an inode is placed on the
t_inode_list; it is to provide the data=ordered guarantees that we
don't end up exposing stale data.  In the case where we are truncating
or punching a hole in the inode, there is no possibility that stale
data could be exposed in the first place, so we don't need to put the
inode on the t_inode_list!

The right long-term fix is to get rid of data=ordered mode altogether,
and only update the extent tree or indirect blocks after the data has
been written.  Until then, this change will also avoid some
unnecessary waiting in the commit operation.
