ext4: return hole from ext4_map_blocks()

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

Currently, ext4_map_blocks() just returns 0 when it finds a hole and
allocation is not requested. However we have all the information
available to tell how large the hole actually is and there are callers
of ext4_map_blocks() which would save some block-by-block hole iteration
if they knew this information. So fill in struct ext4_map_blocks even
for holes with the information we have. We keep returning 0 for holes to
maintain backward compatibility of the function.
