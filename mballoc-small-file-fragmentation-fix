ext4: Avoid group preallocation for closed files

Currently the group preallocation code tries to find a large (512)
free block from which to do per-cpu group allocation for small files.
The problem with this scheme is that it leaves the filesystem horribly
fragmented.  In the worst case, if the filesystem is unmounted and
remounted (after a system shutdown, for example) we forget the fact
that wee were using a particular (now-partially filled) 512 block
extent.  So the next time we try to allocate space for a small file,
we will find *another* completely free 512 block chunk to allocate
small files.  Given that there are 32,768 blocks in a block group,
after 64 iterations of "mount, write one 4k file in a directory,
unmount", the block group will have 64 files, each separated by 511
blocks, and the block group will no longer have any free 512
completely free chunks of blocks for group preallocation space.

So if we try to allocate blocks for a file that has been closed, such
that we know the final size of the file, and the filesystem is not
busy, avoid using group preallocation.
