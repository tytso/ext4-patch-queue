Hi,

Noticed this issue when running make htmldocs.

It gives the following warnings:
.//include/linux/jbd2.h:1033: warning: Excess struct/union/enum/typedef member 'j_history' description in 'journal_s'
.//include/linux/jbd2.h:1033: warning: Excess struct/union/enum/typedef member 'j_history_max' description in 'journal_s'
.//include/linux/jbd2.h:1033: warning: Excess struct/union/enum/typedef member 'j_history_cur' description in 'journal_s'

Thanks,
Luis
