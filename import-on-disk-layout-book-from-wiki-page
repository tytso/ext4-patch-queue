ext4: import on-disk layout book from wiki page

From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

Create the basic structure of the "new" data structures & algorithms
book to be ported over from the on-disk format wiki, and then start by
pulling in the introductory information.

+About this Book
+===============
+
+This document attempts to describe the on-disk format for ext4
+filesystems. The same general ideas should apply to ext2/3 filesystems
+as well, though they do not support all the features that ext4 supports,
+and the fields will be shorter.
+
+**NOTE**: This is a work in progress, based on notes that the author
+(djwong) made while picking apart a filesystem by hand. The data
+structure definitions should be current as of Linux 4.18 and
+e2fsprogs-1.44. All comments and corrections are welcome, since there is
+undoubtedly plenty of lore that might not be reflected in freshly
+created demonstration filesystems.

+
+Terminology
+-----------
+
+ext4 divides a storage device into an array of logical blocks both to
+reduce bookkeeping overhead and to increase throughput by forcing larger
+transfer sizes. Generally, the block size will be 4KiB (the same size as
+pages on x86 and the block layer's default block size), though the
+actual size is calculated as 2 ^ (10 + ``sb.s_log_block_size``) bytes.
+Throughout this document, disk locations are given in terms of these
+logical blocks, not raw LBAs, and not 1024-byte blocks. For the sake of
+convenience, the logical block size will be referred to as
+``$block_size`` throughout the rest of the document.
+
+When referenced in ``preformatted text`` blocks, ``sb`` refers to fields
+in the super block, and ``inode`` refers to fields in an inode table
+entry.
