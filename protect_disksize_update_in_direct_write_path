ext4: protect i_disksize update by i_data_sem in direct write path

From: Eryu Guan <guaneryu@gmail.com>

i_disksize update should be protected by i_data_sem, by either taking
the lock explicitly or by using ext4_update_i_disksize() helper. But the
i_disksize updates in ext4_direct_IO_write() are not protected at all,
which may be racing with i_disksize updates in writeback path in
delalloc buffer write path.

This is found by code inspection, and I didn't hit any i_disksize
corruption due to this bug. Thanks to Jan Kara for catching this bug and
suggesting the fix!

There's no v1 version of this patch.

It's a bit unfortunate that I have to remove the "ei" definition in this
patch and reintroduce it in patch 2/2, otherwise I got transient
"defined but not used" build warning with only this patch applied.
