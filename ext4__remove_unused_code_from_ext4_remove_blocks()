ext4: remove unused code from ext4_remove_blocks()

From: Lukas Czerner <lczerner@redhat.com>

The "head removal" branch in the condition is never used in any code
path in ext4 since the function only caller ext4_ext_rm_leaf() will make
sure that the extent is properly split before removing blocks. Note that
there is a bug in this branch anyway.

This commit removes the unused code completely and makes use of
ext4_error() instead of printk if dubious range is provided.
