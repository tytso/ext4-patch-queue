ext4: don't count external journal blocks as overhead

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

This was fixed for ext3 with:

e6d8fb3 ext3: Count internal journal as bsddf overhead in ext3_statfs

but was never fixed for ext4.

With a large external journal and no used disk blocks, df comes
out negative without this, as journal blocks are added to the
overhead & subtracted from used blocks unconditionally.

ps: since this is stored in the on-disk superblock now, I'm not
sure how to fix up old filesystems, or if it matters much.
