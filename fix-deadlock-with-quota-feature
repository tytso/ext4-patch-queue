ext4: fix deadlock with quota feature

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

We didn't mark hidden quota files with S_NOQUOTA flag and thus quota was
accounted even for quota files. Thus we could recurse back to quota code
when adding new blocks to quota file which can easily deadlock. Mark
hidden quota files properly.
