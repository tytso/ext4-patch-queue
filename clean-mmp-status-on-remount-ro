ext4: clear mmp sequence number when remounting read-only

Previously, when an MMP-protected file system is remounted read-only,
the kmmpd thread would exit the next time it woke up (a few seconds
later), without resetting the MMP sequence number back to
EXT4_MMP_SEQ_CLEAN.

Fix this by explicitly killing the MMP thread when the file system is
remounted read-only.
