ext4: Fix bigalloc quota accounting and i_blocks value

From: Aditya Kali <adityakali@google.com>

With bigalloc changes, the i_blocks value was not correctly set (it was still
set to number of blocks being used, but in case of bigalloc, we want i_blocks
to represent the number of clusters being used). Since the quota subsystem sets
the i_blocks value, this patch fixes the quota accounting and makes sure that
the i_blocks value is set correctly.
