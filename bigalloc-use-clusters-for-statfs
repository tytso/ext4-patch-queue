+ * Note: calculating the overhead so we can be compatible with
+ * historical BSD practice is quite difficult in the face of
+ * clusters/bigalloc.  This is because multiple metadata blocks from
+ * different block group can end up in the same allocation cluster.
+ * Calculating the exact overhead in the face of clustered allocation
+ * requires either O(all block bitmaps) in memory or O(number of block
+ * groups**2) in time.  We will still calculate the superblock for
+ * older file systems --- and if we come across with a bigalloc file
+ * system with zero in s_overhead_clusters the estimate will be close to
+ * correct especially for very large cluster sizes --- but for newer
+ * file systems, it's better to calculate this figure once at mkfs
+ * time, and store it in the superblock.  If the superblock value is
+ * present (even for non-bigalloc file systems), we will use it.
