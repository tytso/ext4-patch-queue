ext4: make sure enough credits are reserved for dioread_nolock writes

There are enough credits reserved for most dioread_nolock writes;
however, if the extent tree is sufficiently deep, and/or quota is
enabled, the code was not allowing for all eventualities when
reserving journal credits for the unwritten extent conversion.

This problem can be seen using xfstests ext4/034:

   WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 257 at fs/ext4/ext4_jbd2.c:271 __ext4_handle_dirty_metadata+0x10c/0x180
