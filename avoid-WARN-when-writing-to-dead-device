ext4: avoid kernel warning when writing the superblock to a dead device

The xfstests generic/475 test switches the underlying device with
dm-error while running a stress test.  This results in a large number
of file system errors, and since we can't lock the buffer head when
marking the superblock dirty in the ext4_grp_locked_error() case, it's
possible the superblock to be !buffer_uptodate() without
buffer_write_io_error() being true.

We need to set buffer_uptodate() before we call mark_buffer_dirty() or
this will trigger a WARN_ON.  It's safe to do this since the
superblock must have been properly read into memory or the mount would
have been successful.  So if buffer_uptodate() is not set, we can
safely assume that this happened due to a failed attempt to write the
superblock.
