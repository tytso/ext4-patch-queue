ext4: do not try to write superblock on ro remount w/o journal

From: Michael Tokarev <mjt@tls.msk.ru>

When a journal-less ext4 filesystem is mounted on a read-only block
device (blockdev --setro will do), each remount (for other, unrelated,
flags, like suid=>nosuid etc) results in a series of scary messages
from kernel telling about I/O errors on the device.

This is becauese of the following code ext4_remount():

       if (sbi->s_journal == NULL)
                ext4_commit_super(sb, 1);

at the end of remount procedure, which forces writing (flushing) of
a superblock regardless whenever it is dirty or not, if the filesystem
is readonly or not, and whenever the device itself is readonly or not.

We only need call ext4_commit_super when the file system had been
previously mounted read/write.

Thanks to Eric Sandeen for help in diagnosing this issue.
