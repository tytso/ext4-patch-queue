ext4: set h_journal if there is a failure starting a reserved handle

If ext4 tries to start a reserved handle via
jbd2_journal_start_reserved(), and the journal has been aborted, this
can result in a NULL pointer dereference.  This is because the fields
h_journal and h_transaction in the handle structure share the same
memory, via a union, so jbd2_journal_start_reserved() will clear
h_journal before calling start_this_handle().  If this function fails
due to an aborted handle, h_journal will still be NULL, and the call
to jbd2_journal_free_reserved() will pass a NULL journal to
sub_reserve_credits().

This can be reproduced by running "kvm-xfstests -c dioread_nolock
generic/475".
