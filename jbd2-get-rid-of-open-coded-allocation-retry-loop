jbd2: get rid of open coded allocation retry loop

From: Michal Hocko <mhocko@suse.cz>

insert_revoke_hash does an open coded endless allocation loop if
journal_oom_retry is true. It doesn't implement any allocation fallback
strategy between the retries, though. The memory allocator doesn't know
about the never fail requirement so it cannot potentially help to move
on with the allocation (e.g. use memory reserves).

Get rid of the retry loop and use __GFP_NOFAIL instead. We will lose the
debugging message but I am not sure it is anyhow helpful.

Do the same for journal_alloc_journal_head which is doing a similar
thing.

Hi,
While looking at something unrelated I have encountered the following
two open coded endless loops around allocation request. I have converted
them to use __GFP_NOFAIL in lines of http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=143377014630186&w=2.

journal_oom_retry is hardcoded to 1 and used only at a single place in
jbd2 code so I guess it is just a left over. Nevertheless, I have kept
it there because I do not understand its historical purpose. Anyway
it seems like removing it would allow some more clean ups because
insert_revoke_hash doesn't have any other failure modes (same applies to
jbd2_journal_set_revoke). Let me know if you would be interested in
such a cleanup.

Thanks!
