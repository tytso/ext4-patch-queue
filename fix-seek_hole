ext4: fix SEEK_HOLE

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

Currently, SEEK_HOLE implementation in ext4 may both return that there's
a hole at some offset although that offset already has data and skip
some holes during a search for the next hole. The first problem is
demostrated by:

xfs_io -c "falloc 0 256k" -c "pwrite 0 56k" -c "seek -h 0" file
wrote 57344/57344 bytes at offset 0
56 KiB, 14 ops; 0.0000 sec (2.054 GiB/sec and 538461.5385 ops/sec)
Whence	Result
HOLE	0

Where we can see that SEEK_HOLE wrongly returned offset 0 as containing
a hole although we have written data there. The second problem can be
demonstrated by:

xfs_io -c "falloc 0 256k" -c "pwrite 0 56k" -c "pwrite 128k 8k"
       -c "seek -h 0" file

wrote 57344/57344 bytes at offset 0
56 KiB, 14 ops; 0.0000 sec (1.978 GiB/sec and 518518.5185 ops/sec)
wrote 8192/8192 bytes at offset 131072
8 KiB, 2 ops; 0.0000 sec (2 GiB/sec and 500000.0000 ops/sec)
Whence	Result
HOLE	139264

Where we can see that hole at offsets 56k..128k has been ignored by the
SEEK_HOLE call.

The underlying problem is in the ext4_find_unwritten_pgoff() which is
just buggy. In some cases it fails to update returned offset when it
finds a hole (when no pages are found or when the first found page has
higher index than expected), in some cases conditions for detecting hole
are just missing (we fail to detect a situation where indices of
returned pages are not contiguous).

Fix ext4_find_unwritten_pgoff() to properly detect non-contiguous page
indices and also handle all cases where we got less pages then expected
in one place and handle it properly there.
