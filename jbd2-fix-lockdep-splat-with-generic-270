jbd2: Fix lockdep splat with generic/270 test

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

I've hit a lockdep splat with generic/270 test complaining that:

3216.fsstress.b/3533 is trying to acquire lock:
 (jbd2_handle){++++..}, at: [<ffffffff813152e0>] jbd2_log_wait_commit+0x0/0x150

but task is already holding lock:
 (jbd2_handle){++++..}, at: [<ffffffff8130bd3b>] start_this_handle+0x35b/0x850

The underlying problem is that jbd2_journal_force_commit_nested()
(called from ext4_should_retry_alloc()) may get called while a
transaction handle is started. In such case it takes care to not wait
for commit of the running transaction (which would deadlock) but only
for a commit of a transaction that is already committing (which is safe
as that doesn't wait for any filesystem locks).

In fact there are also other callers of jbd2_log_wait_commit() that take
care to pass tid of a transaction that is already committing and for
those cases, the lockdep instrumentation is too restrictive and leading
to false positive reports. Fix the problem by calling
jbd2_might_wait_for_commit() from jbd2_log_wait_commit() only if the
transaction isn't already committing.
