ext4: unsigned int compared against zero

From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>

There are two cases where u32 variables n and err are being checked
for less than zero error values, the checks is always false because
the variables are not signed. Fix this by making the variables ints.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
Fixes: 345c0dbf3a30 ("ext4: protect journal inode's blocks using block_validity")
