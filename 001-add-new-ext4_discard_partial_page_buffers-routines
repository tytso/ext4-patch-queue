ext4: Add new ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers routines

From: Allison Henderson <achender@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

This patch adds two new routines: ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers
and ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers_no_lock.

The ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers routine is a wrapper
function to ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers_no_lock.
The wrapper function locks the page and passes it to
ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers_no_lock.
Calling functions that already have the page locked can call
ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers_no_lock directly.

The ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers_no_lock function
zeros a specified range in a page, and unmaps the
corresponding buffer heads.  Only block aligned regions of the
page will have their buffer heads unmapped.  Unblock aligned regions
will be mapped if needed so that they can be updated with the
partial zero out.  This function is meant to
be used to update a page and its buffer heads to be zeroed
and unmapped when the corresponding blocks have been released
or will be released.

This routine is used in the following scenarios:
* A hole is punched and the non page aligned regions
  of the head and tail of the hole need to be discarded

* The file is truncated and the partial page beyond EOF needs
  to be discarded

* The end of a hole is in the same page as EOF.  After the
  page is flushed, the partial page beyond EOF needs to be
  discarded.

* A write operation begins or ends inside a hole and the partial
  page appearing before or after the write needs to be discarded

* A write operation extends EOF and the partial page beyond EOF
  needs to be discarded

This function takes a flag EXT4_DISCARD_PARTIAL_PG_ZERO_UNMAPPED
which is used when a write operation begins or ends in a hole.
When the EXT4_DISCARD_PARTIAL_PG_ZERO_UNMAPPED flag is used, only
buffer heads that are already unmapped will have the corresponding
regions of the page zeroed.
